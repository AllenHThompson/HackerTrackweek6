Hacker Track - Week 6

//a) Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

var i;
var fib = [];
fib[0] = 0;
fib[1] = 1;
for(i = 2; i < Infinity; i++) {
	fib[i] = fib[i-2] + fib[i-1];
	if (fib[i] > 4000000) {
		fib.pop(i);
		break;
	}

}
var n = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < fib.length; i++) {
	if (fib[i] %  2 === 0) {

		n = n + fib[i];
	}
}
console.log(fib[n]);
